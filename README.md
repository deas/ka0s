# ka0s - Experimenting with Chaos on Kubernetes ðŸ§ª

The primary goal of this project is to exercise and experiment with Chaos Engineering tools around Kubernetes. Toolchain setup is based on flux and terraform, since I want to enable development. I consider localhost experience (hence `kind` and maybe `k3s` soon) very important. Given that, some elements may be useful in CI context. Most things however, should play nice on bigger or even produtive environments as well. Again, aiming at a smooth dev experience, I am test driving [devenv as a nix flake](https://devenv.sh/guides/using-with-flakes/). The idea here is to bring in required tooling. Hence, you should be good to go if your host has `nix`. For convenience, you may want to add `direnv`.

This repo is based on [flux-conductr](https://github.com/deas/flux-conductr). Look at that, if you are after a similar development experience, but focused specifically on flux itself.

Even though, I am trying to cover most things declaratively, some random bits may be covered by `make` targets. Simply calling the default target:

```sh
make
```

should output help hinting at what is covered.

Generate ssh deployent keys:

```sh
make gen-keys
```
Add public deployment key to github. You may also want to disable github actions to start.

```sh
make gh-add-deploy-key
```

## Bootrapping

There is a `terraform` + `kind` based bootstrap in [`tf`](./tf).

```sh
cp sample.tfvars terraform.tfvars
# Set proper values in terraform.tfvars
terraform apply
```
Alternatively, you can bootstrap or even upgrade an existing cluster (be sure to have current kube context set properly). Also, make sure `flux --version` shows desired version.

```sh
./scripts/flux-bootstrap.sh
```

## Known Issues
- knative challenging (Some bits need `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/substitute: disabled` in our context, other things need tweaks to upstream yaml to play with GitOps "... configured")

## TODO
- There are TODO tags in the code
- Prometheus/kube-prometheus? Shouldn't istio ship a bit?
- When flux needs to go through a proxy, make sure to enable the patch in `flux-system/kustomization.yaml`
- How to use flux w/o ssh?
- Naming?
- ~~Setup "envs" properly / remove literals~~
- Flux Dashboard?
- [Grafana/Prometheus](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/monitoring/)?
- Validation ( -> Monitoring)
- local k3s (Speed?)
- ca cert mount / proxy env
- Remove image-reflector-controller,image-automation-controller, go public
